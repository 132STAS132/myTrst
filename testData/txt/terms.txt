Rentgrata Terms of Use
Last updated: June 5, 2020
1. Scope of Terms
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND RENTGRATA.
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access and use of the applications, websites, content, products and services (the “Services,” as more fully defined below) provided by Rentgrata Inc. or its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, “Rentgrata”). As used in these Terms, “Renter” means any prospective or actual tenant of a rental property. “Property Manager” means any entity that uses the Services in connection with its business operations. A “User” is, as the context requires, a Renter, a Property Manager, or any other person who accesses or uses the Services. The words “you” and “your” refer to you as a User of the Services.
By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements between Rentgrata and you. Rentgrata may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH RENTGRATA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.
Rentgrata may amend these Terms from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon Rentgrata’s posting of such updated Terms at this location. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting confirms your consent to be bound by these Terms, as amended. If Rentgrata changes these Terms after the date you first agreed to these Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms), and you reject any such changes, your sole recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.
2. Arbitration Agreement
By agreeing to these Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Rentgrata on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Section 2 (such section being referred to in this Agreement as the “Arbitration Agreement”). This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Rentgrata, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Rentgrata by someone else.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Rentgrata.
You and Rentgrata agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to these Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Rentgrata, and not in a court of law.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Rentgrata are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Rentgrata otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Rentgrata each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
Rules and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The parties agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.
Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Illinois.
Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of Illinois and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Rentgrata otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Chicago, Illinois. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Rentgrata submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Decision.
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, only to the extent provided under applicable law.
Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
Changes.
Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 1 above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Rentgrata changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to these Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Rentgrata written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last updated” date above. This written notice must be provided by email from the email address associated with your Account to: support@rentgrata.com. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Rentgrata in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to these Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms).
Severability and Survival.
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
3. The Services
Definition.
The “Services” comprise mobile applications and related services, that enable the efficient exchange of information among and between Renters and Property Managers for those properties.

Terms Applicable to Property Managers
The provisions in this section are particular to Property Managers’ receipt of the Services, including the rights and obligations regarding payment of incentives to Renters. Accordingly, the term “you” in this section refers to Property Managers.
If you have entered into an arrangement with Rentgrata concerning the Services by means of a listing service agreement form or any other means (“Agreement Form”), you agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account (defined below) in accordance with this section.
Unless payment is made by credit card or ACH, you agree to pay all fees specified in the Agreement Form (the “Fees”) within 30 days of date of invoice, all of which are priced in U.S. dollars and shall be paid in U.S. dollars. If payment is made by credit card or ACH, you expressly authorize Rentgrata to automatically charge the applicable charge, or debit your account on a monthly basis and you agree that any fee increase made in accordance with this section may also be charged/debited in the same manner. You shall be responsible for any third party fees such as bank charges. All payments received after the applicable due date will incur a late payment charge from such due date until paid at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.0% per month or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. You agree to pay all of Rentgrata’s costs, including attorneys’ fees, court costs or other costs, incurred in collecting overdue amounts. The Fees do not include sales, use, excise or any other taxes or fees now or hereafter imposed by any governmental authority with respect to the Services.
Rentgrata may: (a) on each anniversary of the last day of the calendar month in which the you first used the Services, increase the Fees by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the previous twelve months; and (b) at any time during a renewal term under the Agreement Form, increase the Fees or charge other fees for any portion of the Services, provided, that if you do not agree to the increase or charge, then you may give Rentgrata written notice of termination within sixty (60) days of Rentgrata’s notice of such increase or charge, in which case you shall continue to pay the Fees in place before the proposed increase or charge until the last day of the calendar month in which your notice of termination is delivered, and the Agreement Form shall terminate with respect to such portion of the Services on such date. Your listings may continue to display for a short period after the elected property monthly budget is reached. As a result, you agree to pay and will be charged at the rate of the Fees up to 20% in excess of the applicable budget set forth in the Agreement Form. Unless you change or remove your payment method, Rentgrata may store and update (e.g. upon expiration) your payment method for use with subsequent campaigns, orders and purchases submitted through your Account.
Rentgrata will have the right to approve your creditworthiness prior to providing the Services. You hereby authorize Rentgrata to obtain credit reports to determine such creditworthiness, and you agree to provide all information that Rentgrata reasonably requires for use in connection with such inquiries.
The term for each Agreement Form shall begin on the date of signature by Rentgrata, shall continue for the initial term specified on the Agreement Form (the “Initial Term”). The term of the Agreement Form shall continue for successive periods equal to the Initial Term (each such successive period being a “Renewal Term”) commencing on the last day of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, unless at least 60 days prior to the last day of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, either party has provided the other written notice of an intent not to renew. You acknowledge that you are responsible for payment of the Fees for the entire Renewal Term unless the Agreement Form is cancelled in accordance with the notice provisions of this Section. Rentgrata reserves the right, in its reasonable discretion, to reject or discontinue any Services (e.g., advertisements) at any time. Rentgrata reserves the right to refuse to provide any advertisements to anyone for competitive and/or other business reasons including non-payment and you agree to pay for all Services rendered, prorated if partially completed. If you cancel any portion of the Services prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, then you shall pay Rentgrata a cancellation fee equal to the amount that would be due in the remainder of the Initial Term or applicable Renewal Term. Either party may immediately terminate an Agreement Form in the event the other party commits a material breach of the Agreement Form and such breach is not cured by the breaching party within 30 days of its receipt of notice of such breach from the non-defaulting party. To be effective, terminations under this Section must be emailed to ben@rentgrata.com. Rentgrata and you may agree to revoke any termination, in which case, the Agreement Form will remain in effect.

6. General Provisions
Choice of Law.
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement above. However, the choice of law provision regarding the interpretation of these Terms is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-Illinois residents to assert claims under Illinois law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise. These provisions, and except as otherwise provided in Section 2 of these Terms, are only intended to specify the use of Illinois law to interpret these Terms and the forum for disputes asserting a breach of these Terms, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending Illinois law to you if you do not otherwise reside in Illinois. The foregoing choice of law and forum selection provisions do not apply to the arbitration clause in Section 2 or to any arbitrable disputes as defined therein. Instead, as described in Section 2, the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to any such disputes.
