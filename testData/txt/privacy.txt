Rentgrata Privacy Policy
Capitalized words that are not defined in this policy have the meanings given to them in the Rentgrata Terms of Use
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information we collect when you use the Services. This policy does not describe information collection policies of parties other than Rentgrata (for example, Facebook). It also does not cover information you may choose to share with other Users of the Services.
The Information We Collect
To provide the Services, we collect various kinds of information from the different parties involved. We collect information from Property Managers that may include apartment listing data and contact information (address, phone number, email address). From Renters we collect name, address (including apartment number, if applicable), email address, phone number, lease start date, lease end date, unit bed and bath count, chat content and history with other Users of the Services, profile photos, Facebook friends, and interests as selected by the User.
From time to time we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Services, such as the time and date of your visit, the pages that you access, and the number of times you return to the website. This information is not used to identify you, but is used in the aggregate for Rentgrata's internal marketing and similar purposes. This process may involve the automatic placement of a small, removable text file (commonly referred to as a “cookie”) on your computer's hard drive.
How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect
We use the information we collect to facilitate your use of the Services for its intended purposes. For example, we display apartment listing data and Property Managers’ contact information within the Services so that Renters can browse and contact the Property Managers of properties in which they are interested.
Rentgrata may automatically send information collected from Renters, such as name, email address, phone number, move-in date, chat content and history to a Property Manager so that the Property Manager may be made aware of Renter’s interest in a given property, interest expressed by the Renter by sending or attempting to send a message to another User via the Services.
We display Renters’ names, desired lease start date, apartment number (if a current resident of their property), email addresses, and phone numbers to Property Managers so the Property Managers may contact the Renter or be made aware of which current Renters are potentially eligible for a referral reward.
We use lease start date information to track when a user's current lease is about to expire for our own marketing purposes.
The Services displays Facebook photos and information to help make Renters aware of their Facebook friends who are also using the Services either as a current resident or prospective resident.
Users’ chat content and history is used to monitor the content that is being uploaded to the Services and help deter any harmful or discriminatory activity or language. Chat content of Renters can also be provided to Property Managers to make them aware of what is being said about their property or competing properties, good or bad. We may also use chat content and history for marketing purposes between and among Property Managers.
Users of the Services can see each other’s likes and interests and address (not including apartment number) if the address is currently tied to a listing.
We may use the personally identifiable information we collect to communicate with you from time to time on topics that we believe may be of interest to you.
We do not sell your personally identifiable information to any third party.
We may also disclose your personally identifiable information (such as name, email address and phone number) to certain third parties that we have engaged as subcontractors to support our internal business operations, including customer support and marketing.
We may otherwise disclose information about you to third parties if we have a good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to legal claims, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Rentgrata or others.
We may disclose information about you to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale or disposition of all or a portion Rentgrata’s assets. The successor organization’s use and disclosure of your personally-identifiable information will continue to be subject to this policy unless (i) a court orders otherwise, for example a bankruptcy court, or (ii) the successor organization gives you notice that your personally-identifiable information will be subject to the successor organization’s own privacy policy, along with an opportunity for you to opt out (which may cause you to not be able to continue to use the Services). If you submit personally-identifiable information after such a transfer, that information may be subject to the successor entity’s privacy policy.
Children's Issues
The Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age, and children under 13 years of age may not use the Services to submit any personally identifiable information about themselves.
Changes To This Privacy Policy
Rentgrata may revise and update this policy at any time. We will notify you by email at the address we have on file, if any, if there are any material changes to this policy. Your continued use of the Services after receiving notice of any changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes.
Last Update
This policy was last updated on, and is effective as of, June 11, 2020.
